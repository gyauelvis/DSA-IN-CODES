## Exceptions

1. An exception is an occurrence of an undesirable situation that can be 
detected during program execution.<br>
2. Some typical ways of dealing with exceptions are to use an if statement or 
the assert function.<br>
3. The function assert can check whether an expression meets the required 
condition(s). If the conditions are not met, it terminates the program.<br>
4. The try/catch block is used to handle exceptions within a program.
 5. Statements that may generate an exception are placed in a try block. The 
try block also contains statements that should not be executed if an excep
tion occurs.<br>
6. The try block is followed by one or more catch blocks.
 A catch block specifies the type of exception it can catch and contains an 
exception handler.<br>

7. If the heading of a catch block contains . . . (ellipsis) in place of param
eters, then this catch block can catch exceptions of all types.

8. If no exceptions are thrown in a try block, all catch blocks associated with 
that try block are ignored and program execution resumes after the last 
catch block.
9. If an exception is thrown in a try block, the remaining statements in the 
try block are ignored. The program searches the catch blocks, in the 
order they appear after the try block, and looks for an appropriate excep
tion handler. If the type of the thrown exception matches the parameter 
type in one of the catch blocks, then the code in that catch block executes 
and the remaining catch blocks after this catch block are ignored.

10. The data type of the catch block parameter specifies the type of exception 
that the catch block can catch.

11. A catch block can have, at most, one catch block parameter.
12. If only the data type is specified in a catch block heading, that is, if there is 
no catch block parameter, then the thrown value may not be accessible in 
the catch block exception-handling code.
13. In order for an exception to occur in a try block and be caught by a catch 
block, the exception must be thrown in the try block.
14. The general syntax to throw an exception is
 ```c++
 throw expression;
in which `expression` is a constant value, variable, or object. The object 
being thrown can be either a specific object or an anonymous object.

15. C++ provides support to handle exceptions via a hierarchy of classes.

16. The class exception is the base class of the exception classes provided 
by C++.
17. The function what returns the string containing the exception object 
thrown by C11â€™s built-in exception classes.
 The class exception is contained in the header file exception.
 The two classes that are immediately derived from the class exception 
are logic_error and runtime_error. Both of these classes are defined in 
the header file stdexcept.
 The class invalid_argument is designed to deal with illegal arguments 
used in a function call.
 The class out_of_range deals with the string subscript out_of_range error.
 If a length greater than the maximum allowed for a string object is used, 
the class length_error deals with this error.
 If the operator new cannot allocate memory space, this operator throws a 
bad_alloc exception.
