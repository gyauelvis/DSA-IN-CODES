// Write a program that prompts the user to enter time in 12-hour 
// notation. The program then outputs the time in 24-hour notation. 
// Your program must contain three exception classes: invalidHr, 
// invalidMin, and invalidSec. If the user enters an invalid value 
// for hours, then the program should throw and catch an invalidHr 
// object. Follow similar conventions for the invalid values of minutes 
// and seconds.
