// Letâ€™s	say	that	you	are	writing	a	JavaScript	application,	and	somewhere	in	your
//  code	you	find	that	you	need	to	get	the	intersection	between	two	arrays.	The
//  intersection	is	a	list	of	all	the	values	that	occur	in	both	of	the	arrays.	For
//  example,	if	you	have	the	arrays	[3,	1,	4,	2]	and	[4,	5,	3,	6],	the	intersection	would	be
//  a	third	array,	[3,	4],	since	both	of	those	values	are	common	to	the	two	arrays
