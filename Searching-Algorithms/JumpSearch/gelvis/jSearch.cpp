// The goal is to reduce the number of elements to be checked by skipping elements
// that are not likely to be searched for, and then perform linear search on the remaining elements.
// The jump block is calculated by taking the square root of the array length.
// The left pointer is then incremented by the jump block until the value at the left pointer is greater than the search value.
// The right pointer is then set to the left pointer minus the jump block.
// The time complexity of jump search is O(âˆšn) and the space complexity is O(1).
