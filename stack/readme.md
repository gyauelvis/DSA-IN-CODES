## Stack Operations

 - `initializeStack:` Initializes the stack to an empty state.
 - `isEmptyStack:` Determines whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it returns the value true otherwise, it returns the value false.
 - `isFullStack:` Determines whether the stack is full. If the stack is full, it returns the value true; otherwise, it returns the value false.
 - `push:` Adds a new element to the top of the stack. The input to this operation consists of the stack and the new element. Prior to this operation, the stack must exist and must not be full.
 - `top:` Returns the top element of the stack. Prior to this operation, the stack must exist and must not be empty.
 - `pop:` Removes the top element of the stack
